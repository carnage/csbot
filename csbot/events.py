def proxy(*args, **kwargs):
    """Here be dragons (and magic).

    This is a decorator for creating methods on :class:`.BotProtocol` that
    result in events that can be hooked by the bot and plugins.

    When the new method is called, the decorated method is called first, as
    normal.  Afterwards an :class:`Event` is created and the arguments are
    stored in it as attributes.  By default the :attr:`~Event.event_type` is
    the name of the method being decorated.  This event is passed to
    :meth:`.Bot.fire_hook`, which is responsible for firing the bot's and
    plugins' handlers for the event.

    If the decorator is used without arguments, the attribute names are defined
    by the parameter names of the decorated method::

        class BotProtocol(IRCClient):
            # Creates events with 'user', 'channel' and 'message' attributes
            @events.proxy
            def privmsg(self, user, channel, message):
                pass

    If the decorator has arguments, then these define the attribute names
    instead::

        class BotProtocol(IRCClient):
            # Creates events with 'u', 'c' and 'msg' attributes
            @events.proxy('u', 'c', 'msg')
            def privmsg(self, user, channel, message):
                pass

    If the decorator has the *name* keyword argument it's used instead of the
    method to define :attr:`~Event.event_type`::

        class BotProtocol(IRCClient):
            # Fires the 'messageReceived' event instead of 'privmsg'
            @events.proxy(name='messageReceived')
            def privmsg(self, user, channel, message):
                pass

    Usually the decorated methods won't return anything, and the original
    arguments are re-used for the :class:`Event`.  If the method *does* return
    something, it will be treated as a tuple of arguments that should be used
    instead of the original arguments::

        class BotProtocol(IRCClient):
            # Pretend we can't hear Alan
            @events.proxy
            def privmsg(self, user, channel, message):
                if nick(user) == 'Alan':
                    return (user, channel, '')

            # Make an event with a completely different signature
            @events.proxy('users')
            def userJoined(self, user, channel):
                self.users[channel].add(user)
                return (self.users[channel],)

    Docstrings on each decorated method are automatically augmented with
    information about the events generated, and a link to the Twisted
    documentation if the method implements part of the Twisted
    :class:`IRCClient` interface.
